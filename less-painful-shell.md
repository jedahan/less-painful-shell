# less painful shell

```zsh
echo "$SHELL == $TERM?"
```
```zsh
[[ $SHELL = $TERM ]] && echo its the same || echo nope
```

# less painful shell

```zsh
echo "$SHELL != $TERM"
```

This is mostly about working with shell scripts.

Can do a followup about Terminals if folks are interested.

Do not feel bad if this distinction is unclear.

It is the nature of the beast.

1. commands 

```zsh
whence $SHELL
```

# learning

1. commands `whence`
2. variables

```zsh
export WHENCE=$(whence $SHELL)
echo $WHENCE becomes ${WHENCE/bin/secret}
```

# learning

> shell is like 7 languages, focus on a few

1. commands `whence`
2. variables `echo ${WHENCE/bin/secret}`
3. control flow

```zsh
if [[ $SHELL == '/bin/zsh' ]]
then
  echo neat
fi
```

## run everything when unsure!

`podman run --rm --interactive ghcr.io/zsh-users/zsh:5.9 zsh -c`

## restict feature use...

Not advocating for full posix sh, but shell has decades of cruft

## ...but avoid re-inventing features!

Features worth incorporating: `pipes`, `redirection`, `signals`, `long options`

## strict mode

```bash
set -euo pipefail
```

Its actually `set -e`, `set -u`, `set -o pipefail` 

Learn to set and unset options

# solidifying

philosophy
* long options
* good, bad and ugly of shellcheck 

materiality
* info() / trap()
* printf vs echo
* subshells and scope `$()` vs `()`, and why use `{}`
